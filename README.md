Years have passed since the end of the Fifth Holy Grail War in Japan. Now, signs portend the emergence of a new Holy Grail in the western American city of Snowfield. Sure enough, Masters and Servants begin to gather... <br><br>\n\nA missing Servant class...<br>\nImpossible Servant summonings...<br>\nA nation shrouded in secrecy...<br>\nAnd a city created as a battleground.<br>\n<br>\nIn the face of such irregularities, the Holy Grail War is twisted and driven into the depth of madness. Let the curtain rise on a masquerade of humans and heroes, made to dance upon the stage of a false Holy Grail. <i>This is a Holy Grail War covered in lies.</i>\n<br><br>\n(Source: Official Site, Aniplex USA, edited)\n<br><br>\n<i>Notes:</i><br>\n\u2022  <i>Special premiere of Episode 1 in its English Dub occurred in Los Angeles at the Fate 20th Anniversary Showcase event and as well through Crunchyroll\u2019s YouTube Channel on November 23, 2024 before the Japanese television premiere.</i><br>\n\u2022  <i>The Japanese advanced premiere occurred during the \"Fate New Year's Eve TV Special 2024\" on December 31, 2024.</i>"
